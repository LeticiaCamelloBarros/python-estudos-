# problem : 
Given a list of strings words, calculate a new list where only the first letter of each word is stored if the word is palindrome.

Store the new list in a variable named new_words.

A palindrome is a string that remains the same even when read backwards, for example "php".

# my solution : 
words = eval(input())  # Don't change this line
new_words = [x[0] for x in words if x == x[::-1]]
