# chalenge : 
Create function named process_numbers that takes a list of numbers and processes them according to specific rules.

Requirements:

First filter out all negative numbers and zero
Then for the remaining positive numbers:
Double even numbers
Triple odd numbers
Use map() and filter() to solve the problem.

#my solution : 
def process_numbers(numbers):
   not_neg = filter(lambda x : x > 0 , numbers)    
   double_triple = map(lambda x:  x*2 if x % 2 == 0 else x*3, not_neg)
   processed_numbers = double_triple
   return list(processed_numbers)
